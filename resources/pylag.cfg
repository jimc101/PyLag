[NUMERICS]
# The numerical method used to compute changes in particle positions. This option
# controls whether operator splitting is used to split the contributions of
# advection and diffusion.
# standard          - The iterative method is set through the option `iterative_method'.
#                     The specified iterative method may correspond to cases of pure
#                     advection, pure diffusion or both. In the case of the latter,
#                     operator splitting is not performed; rather the effects of both
#                     processes are computed at the same time using the same time step by
#                     the specified iterative method. StdNumMethod objects require no
#                     knowledge or the type of iterative method being used - they simply
#                     use it compute the change in a particle's position.
# operator_split_0  - A form of operator splitting in which the advection step is
#                     performed first followed by the diffusion step. The iterative 
#                     methods used for the advection and diffusion steps are set through
#                     the options `adv_iterative_method' and `diff_iterative_method' 
#                     respectively. The parameter `n_sub_time_steps' sets the number 
#                     of diffusion time steps for each advection step.
# operator_split_1  - A form of operator splitting in which a half step for diffusion 
#                     is performed first followed by a full advection step followed
#                     by a half diffusion step. The iterative methods used for the advection
#                     and diffusion steps are set through the options `adv_iterative_method'
#                     and `det_iterative_method' respectively.

# The iterative method used to simulate pure advection, pure diffusion or both combined

# both advection and diffusion, "AdvDiff" is appended to the beginning of the name. The

#                          viscosity is now read from file. As in the 1D case, this scheme should
#                          not be used if the eddy viscosity field is inhomogeneous.
