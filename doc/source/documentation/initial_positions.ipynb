    "# Particle initial positions\n",
    "\n",
    "*PyLag* must be given the initial positions of particles at the start of each new simulation. When running *PyLag* from the command line, particle initial positions can be specified in one of two ways. In the first approach, particle initial positions are read in from a text file with a specified format, as outlined below. In the second approach, particle initial positions are read from a restart file which has been created at the end of or during a previous simulation. The choice is specified in the run configuration file. In *pylag-tools*, a number tools have been provided to help with the creation of particle initial position files. These are described below.\n",

    "## Release zones\n",

    "To assist with connectivty studies, support for the creation of individual circular *release zones* has been added. In *PyLag-tools*, any number of particles can be placed in a release zone and their positions recorded in an initial positions file. Particles may be either *regularly* or *randomly* distributed within the zone. The former method is discontinuous, and only the latter guarantees that the specified number of particles will be added. If all particles that start out in a given *release zone* are given the same *group ID*, they can easily be tracked as a group. The following code illustrates the two ways in which particles can be scattered within a release zone."

    "In applied work, it is often desirable to create a set of distinct release zones, each containing some number of particles. In addition to the creation of single release zones, *PyLag-tools* includes functionality that makes it possible to create sets of release zones. Two standard approaches are supported: a) the creation of a set of release zones along a specified cord, and b) the creation of a set of release zones along the edge of a polygon. The latter method has been introduced to make it possible to create sets of adjacent release zones that follow a coastline defined by a given polygon at some spefied fixed distance from the shore. Both approaches are described below.\n",

    "* **x1** is the particle's first position coordinate. In a cartesian coordinate system, this should be *x* in meters. In a spherical polar coordinate system, it should be the particle's longitude in degrees east.\n",

The choice is set in the [run configuration file](./configuration.ipynb) using the option `depth_coordinates`. Depth is positive up. Thus, if `depth_coordinates` is set to `depth_below_surface`, a depth, $z$, of -0.1 would specify a starting *z* position 0.1 m below the free surface. The model will interpolate the free surface height to the particle's position in time and space, so you don't need to worry about what the sea surface height is at a particlular point in time (unless you set a starting depth that lies below the sea floor). There is also an option to start particles off from a specified distance above the sea floor.\n",
