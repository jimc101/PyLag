The corresponding streamlines are given by $\\Psi = \\{0.5, 1, 2\\}$. Given the initial particle coordinates, we can use PyLag to compute particle pathlines, which can be compared directly with the above streamlines. To do this, we use one of PyLag's numerical integration schemes. The integration is managed by an object of type `pylag.numerics.NumIntegrator`, which in turn farms out most of the hard work to an object of type `pylag.numerics.ItMethod`. Given the type of flow field, we will use `StdNumIntegrator` to manage the integration, and the `Adv_RK4_2D` iterative method, which encodes a fourth order runga kutta scheme.
