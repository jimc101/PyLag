    "# Vertical mixing with numeric inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceeding example, we looked at vertical mixing using an analytic diffusivity profile. The use of an analytic profile meant that we didn't have to interpolate between discrete data points when computing either the vertical eddy diffusivity or any of its derivatives. In more realisitic applications - for example, involving the outputs of a numerical model - this is not the case. Rather, we must interpolate between discrete data points to particle positions in order to obtain the data needed to compute changes in a particle's position. Mathematically, there are many different ways to interpolate between discrete data points, and the choice of interpolation scheme can have a marked effect on the model outputs. Furthermore, the result is also influenced by the number of particles used in the simulation, and the resolution of the vertical grid on which input data are defined. In this example, we investigate these dependencies using outputs from the [General Ocean Turbulence Model (*GOTM*)](https://github.com/gotm-model). The example draws some of its inspiration from the work of Grawe et al (2012), who assessed the merits of using numerical integration schemes of varying order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *GOTM* outputs used have been pre-generated and made available for download. In total, four *GOTM* output files are needed to run the experiments described here. These correspond to model runs that use a varying number of vertical layers, but in other ways are identical. The outputs can be [downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15UX7Y9JnuLpnPAz700mzmzd917nTClxR). If you would like to run the code in this notebook interactively, download the data into a directory of your chooising. By default, the notebook will look for these files in the directory `${HOME}/data/pylag_doc`. To change this, simply update the *data_dir* path below."

    "In this example, we will compare outputs from the particle tracking model with those of a Eulerian model that simulates the vertical mixing of a single passive tracer or \"dye\" in 1D. For this, we use the DYE module from the [Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (*FABM*)](https://github.com/fabm-model), coupled to *GOTM*. We use a *GOTM* configuration for Station L4, which forms part of the [Western Channel Observatory (WCO)](https://www.westernchannelobservatory.org.uk/). The site has a depth of appriximately 50 m. We configure *FABM-GOTM* to release the dye at a point in space near to the ocean's surface and a time in Summer when the water column is stratified. Below, we plot the temporal evolution of the eddy diffusivity field and tracer concentration as simulated using two *GOTM* configurations: one using 20 vertical layers and a second using 200 vertical layers. The data are plotted for a single week at the end of June in 2010. When *GOTM* was run, data were saved every 30 minutes."

    "It is clear from the top two panels that the water column is strongly stratified during this time, with a low diffusivity region separating top and bottom layers that are characterised by high levels of mixing. The periodicity evident in the bottom mixed layer reflects the action of the tides. In the bottom two figures, it can be seen the tracer exhibits a clear partitioning, with the majority persisting in the surface mixed layer while only small quantities have managed to mix down into deeper layers. The tracer was injected into the surface when the simulation started on 1st June 2010, at a time when the water column was also stratified. Over the month of the simulation, it has been effectively mixed within the surface layers, but under stratified conditions, it has not mixed throughout the water column.\n",

In so doing, we will investigate how differences between the two fields depend on a) the resolution of the vertical grid on which the input data are defined, b) the number of particles used in the particle release experiments, and c) the vertical interpolation scheme. For this, we will work with the 1D Milstein numerical approximation. For a similar investigation that uses higher order numerical approximations, the reader is referred to Grawe et al (2012).\n",

The GOTM configurations are distinguished by the number of vertical levels used. These were 20, 50, 100, and 200 vertical levels. In each case, particles are released from the middle of the top-most cell at the start of the simulation. The release location corresponds to the same point in space where the Eulerian tracer is released in the GOTM-FABM runs.

    "It should be pointed out that the above plot shows results for a single run with relatively few particles. As the model is stochastic, a second simulation would produce slightly different results. With this in mind, there are features within the figures that are worthy of comment. Firstly, the Eulerian tracer fields are not identical, which is to be expected - the two *GOTM* runs were performed using two different vertical grids. Second, in qualitative terms at least, there appears to be a better match between the particle and Eulerian fields in the run that used 200 vertical layers. In particular, the sharp gradient in the tracer field at a depth of around 15 m is not reproduced well in the run that used just 20 vertical layers. We can also compare the Eulerian and particle fields in more quantitative terms. Below, we compare the Eulerian and particle fields by computing the RMSE for all depth levels at six hour intervals over the last week of the simulation."

It can be seen the Euler, Visser and Milstein methods all perform simularly. This is to be expected, as they all converge with the same order in the weak sense, and it is this property that we are testing here. What is also striking is the effect of putting a spline through the data points and using it for the interpolation. It can be seen that this markedly reduces the RMSE, especially for GOTM configurations that used just 10 or 50 vertical levels."
