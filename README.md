PyLag is an offline particle tracking model. The model expects as inputs time independent and/or dependent variables that describe the state of a given fluid. These may be measured quantities or the predictions of an analytical or numerical model. Using these, the model computes Lagrangian trajectories for particles released into the fluid at a particular point in time and space. The model is primarily aimed at marine applications, but is intended to be versatile enough to be extended to other contexts; for example, studies of atmospheric dispersion.

PyLag was created with the aim to make available a particle tracking model that is a) fast to run, b) easy to use, c) extensible and d) flexible. The model is written in a mixture of [Python](http://www.python.org) and [Cython](http://www.cython.org).
